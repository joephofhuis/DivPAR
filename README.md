Diversity Perspectives in Annual Reports (DivPAR)

In organizational communication, different perspectives can be identified with regard to management of cultural diversity. Examining the prevalence and development of these perspectives across organizations, sectors, and countries, can reveal much about how views on workplace diversity evolve over time. DivPAR is a digital tool which enables scholars to engage in such research on a large scale. It conducts automated content analysis of corporate annual reports, identifying the presence of three cultural diversity perspectives â€“ the Moral, Market, and Innovation perspectives, based on earlier work by Robin Ely and David Thomas (2001). 

For a full description of the development and validation of DivPAR, and an overview of future uses, we'd like to refer you to the following article:
